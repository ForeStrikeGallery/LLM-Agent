# LLM-Agent
An autonomous GPT-3 agent.

I understand that this code looks ugly and needs some cleaning up but unfortunately I am too lazy to do that at the moment. 

## How to run

1. Install OpenAI's library `pip3 install openai`
2. Add your own OpenAI API Key where it's written "your api key" in `agent.py`
3. Run `python3 agent.py`
