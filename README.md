# LLM-Agent
An autonomous AI agent running on GPT-3.5. You'll need an OpenAI API key to run it. 

Sorry about the code being messy. I will clean it up later. 

## How to run

1. Install OpenAI's library `pip3 install openai`
2. Create a file called `secrets.json` and write this into it: `{"apiKey": "<your openAI api key>"}` 
3. Run `python3 agent.py`
